    "# Sentiment analysis in newspapers\n",
    "The program is meant to analyse the sentiment in newspapers using the NLTK library.\n",
    "## Current version\n",
    "The program uses BeautifulSoup to get the headline and the article from the Fox News webpage. Then it analyses the text using a sentiment analysis tool incorporated into Vader. The program tokenises the text, lemmatises it, and removes non-alphabetic characters. Then the program removes stopwords (e.g. articles.) from the list of tokens. The text processing ends with merging the list of tokens into one list and analysing using Sentiment Intensity Analyzer. In the main version, the program saves the results in new files. In this assignment, the program prints the results in the terminal. In the next step, the program tokenises the article into sentences. Then, each sentence is analysed separately. In the end, the program summarises the sentiment score for the sentences.\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "I tested the program on two articles from Fox News: _Biden admin's plan for mass release of migrants into US outlined in internal 2022 memo_ and _Florida National Guard troops 'proud to help’ fight Texas border crisis, DeSantis says_. The first text seemed negative towards President **Biden's administration**, while the second was positive towards **Republican governors**. As such, the result of sentiment analysis was predictable, and malfunction was easily detected.\n",
    "## Senitment analysis theory\n",
    "### Sentiment classification\n",
    "There are three levels to consider (D'Andrea et al., 2015):\n",
    "* document level – we treat the whole document as a basic\u000b",
    " information unit;\n",
    "* sentence-level – we treat each sentence as an information unit;\n",
    "* aspect-level – each aspect of entities is treated as an information unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NLTK\n",
    "The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a library in Python for NLP tasks. It provides numerous tools for processing and analyzing text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why NLTK?\n",
    "* NLTK library provides built-in modules, including tokenization, lemmatization and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "* It provides pre-trained/evaluated models and datasets.\n",
    "* Documentation, support and customization are easily found online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)\n",
    "The VADER lexicon is designed for sentiment analysis in social media texts. It contains words and their associated sentiment scores. The VADER algorithm is more useful for SA of short texts (social media) – it focuses on elements like emoticons or capitalization. However, for this project, the program correctly calculated the sentiment of the given text (newspaper article).\n",

    "The second article covered how Republican governors responded to the migrant crisis in the United States. The predicted result was a positive sentiment score. This time the program was also correct. In both text and sentence analysis, the resulting sentiment score was positive. However, the sentiment for the headline was negative, which suggests problems in detecting sentiment for more subtle, ambiguous sentences.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "The program correctly detected sentiment using both methods (analysing the processed text and analysing the sentences). However, the program detected negative sentiment in the headline of the second article. That suggests that the tools provided by the NLTK library might be imprecise. The text with ambiguous/mixed sentiment will be challenging for analysis. What is more, SA tools might have problems with sarcasm or irony.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, NLTK provides convenient and efficient tools for SA (e.g. \"SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\" with sentiment and compound scores). Preprocessing - tokenisation, removing special characters, stopwords and lemmatisation can improve the accuracy of SA. However, it is essential to remember the limitations.\n",
